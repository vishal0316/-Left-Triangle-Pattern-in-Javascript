# -Left-Triangle-Pattern-in-Javascript

To create the left triangle pattern in javascript again run 2 nested for loop external loop will take care of columns of pattern and the internal loop will print rows of the pattern.

You can observe from the above-shown pattern that we need to run an external loop for 'n' time while the internal loop runs for 1 time in the first execution, 2 times in the second execution, and so on till 'n' times.

You can use the value of i from the external loop which will increase from 1 to 'n' inside the internal loop as a condition.
